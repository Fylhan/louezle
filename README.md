Install the Vendor Libraries

If you downloaded the archive "without vendors" or installed via git, then
you need to download all of the necessary vendor libraries. If you're not
sure if you need to do this, check to see if you have a ``vendor/`` directory.
If you don't, or if that directory is empty, run the following:

    php bin/vendors install

Note that you **must** have git installed and be able to execute the `git`
command to execute this script. If you don't have git available, either install
it or download Symfony with the vendor libraries already included.
